Menu-http simulates a simple request-response menu browser application.


It's divided into logically separate HTTP daemons.

0. 
The content of Menus are encoded as JSON in the following format.

menus/sample1.json
{
  "index": [
    "menu",
    [
      [
        "pizza",
        "Pizza"
      ],
      [
        "coconut",
        "Coconut"
      ]
    ]
  ],
  "pizza": [
    "url",
    "http:\/\/url1"
  ],
  "coconut": [
    "url",
    "http:\/\/url2"
  ]
}


The entire JSON is a hash.

Each key-value pair denotes a "uri" to "response" mapping.

In the first key-value pair above for example, the uri is "index" and the response is a "menu"

The uri is always a string. We suggest following canonical URI notation, separating logical divisions by a "/" and omitting a preceding "/" - for e.g. "index" rather than "/index"

Response can be of many arbitrary types but it is ALWAYS a two-valued single-dimensional array - the first element is a response type (in the first case above "menu" and in the second case "url") and the second element is the content of the response which might vary according to the response type.


1. 
Content-HTTP daemon is responsible for serving content from the JSON format. It is a dumb daemon and will not need to be changed to handle most flow requirements. The only special response type it recognizes (for reasons that will become obvious) is a "menu".

It has two HTTP primitives:
* /response/:menu_name/:uri
This serves the response for menu_name & uri in JSON format by simply fetching the hash response.

For e.g. /response/sample1/index is returns:
["menu",[["pizza","Pizza"],["coconut","Coconut"]]]

Response is always a two-valued single dimensional JSON array.

* /key/:menu_name/:uri/:choice
This gets the key name for any URI and a particular choice. Menu choices are numbered from 0 onwards, just like a C array.

For e.g. /key/sample1/index/1 returns: 
["coconut"] 
(which is the second key)

The return type here is always a single-valued single-dimensional JSON array which contains the key name.

2.
Flow-HTTP is responsible for overall flow and session handling. It is a smarter daemon and will need to be changed to handle most flow requirements. It for e.g. can process redirects or handle URL request responses, external DB lookups, etc.

Menu clients interact directly with Flow-HTTP and passes on a unique client_id parameter to identify itself uniquely.

Flow-HTTP has just a single HTTP primitive:
* /:menu_name/:client_id/:input
which for a given client with a unique client_id will return it's next response. 
The response can be a further nested menu or other response primitives.
 :input is an integer menu choice, starting from 0 like a C array.
 :input must be "index" to denote a start of menu flow.
 
For e.g. two simultaneous requests will return:
* /sample1/991/index
(this means that the flow is just starting off for user with client_id 991)
so response is:
["menu",[["pizza","Pizza"],["coconut","Coconut"]]]
* /sample1/991/1
This means that the user with client_id 991 has now picked choice id 1 (which is actually the second choice) so the response is:
["url","http:\/\/url2"]

Response is currently JSON, but this can be changed depending on the client consumer. It can for example, be tailored to a specific USSD request-response client.


3. tester.rb is a simple command-line client to test menus.
It uses flow-http.rb to work.

4. A very simple builder.rb is also included. The steps used to generate sample1.json are:

What you have to type is prefixed with a '>'

> ruby -rubygems menu-builder.rb
Menu URI?
> index
Enter your next type (default 'menu')
> (Press Enter)
Next menu choice name?
> Pizza
Next menu uri target?
> pizza
Continue menu choices? (y/n)
> y
Next menu choice name?
> Coconut
Next menu uri target?
> coconut
Continue menu choices? (y/n)
> n
Continue menu creation? (y/n)
> y
Menu URI?
> pizza
Enter your next type (default 'menu')
> url
Menu value?
> http://url1
Continue menu creation? (y/n)
> y
Menu URI?
> coconut
Enter your next type (default 'menu')
> url
Menu value?
> http://url2
Continue menu creation? (y/n)
> n
Created Menu:
(menu will be outputted here.)

So why the content and flow separation?
* Content can serve multiple flow daemons. There can be a generic flow daemon which handles the most common type of responses (and which works from a GUI generated JSON output) and specialized ones for more complicated tasks.
* Content daemon can be modified to reload changed menus (using a periodic mtime check on menus/*.json) on the fly without affecting flow. This is a TODO.
